# Orthogonal Circles
Practicing building an interactive user interface, where user can click and drag on vertices to change the image that is drawn.

Users can change the triangle by dragging its vertices, changing its incircle and circumcircle (whose centers are the intersection points of the triangle's angle bisectors and orthogonal bisectors, respectively).
